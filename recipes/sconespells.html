    <p><h2 class="paragraph">Ingredients</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups of all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup of cold unsalted butter (cut into small pieces)</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            <li>raisins</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p><h2 class="paragraph">Steps To Follow</h2></p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425°F (220°C)</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.</li>
            <li>Add the cold butter pieces and use your fingers to rub them into the dry ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
            <li>Next, make a well in the center of the mixture and pour in the milk and vanilla extract. Stir gently until just combined, being careful not to overmix. The dough should be slightly sticky.</li>
            <li>Add some raisins to the dough, mixing gently.</li>
            <li>After that, turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it gently a few times until it comes together. Pat the dough into a circle about 1 inch thick.</li>
            <li>Now, using a round cookie cutter or a glass, cut out scones from the dough and place them onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Make sure to leave some space between each scone.</li>
            <li>Almost there! Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk to give them a nice golden color when they bake.</li>
            <li>Press some more raisins into the tops as decor.</li>
            <li>Then, pop them into the preheated oven and bake for about 12-15 minutes, or until they are lightly golden on top.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>And now that those magic scones are baking, how about some tea or coffee to go along with them? And don't forget to enchant your freshly baked masterpieces with jam and clotted cream, once they have cooled off a little. </p>
